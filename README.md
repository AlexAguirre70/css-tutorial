# CSS Tutorial Project

This repo is an intro project to basic CSS styling.<br/>
It will have inline, internal and external css styling.
<br/>
<br/>

### Inline CSS
We can use the style attribute within the tags to add styling by selecting the keyword: value ;
<br/>
While it is easy to make changes on the fly. There is a downside. If you have a lot of similar elements that you would like to change, then you would need to make changes to each of them individually. I also make your html code harder to read.
<br/>
<br/>

### Internal CSS
One way to use internal css is to add the style element within the head tag and add the keyword:values for the elements we want to change. We do this by selecting the tag we want to change and then inside the curly braces adding all the keyword:value; pairs we want to use.
<br />
* example: h1{ color: red; font-size:50px;}
<br/>
All the changes you make in the head section cascade to all the same tag elements on the same page.
<br/>
This works great, but when you have more than 1 page website, you will need to add the same styling inside the head tag, and if you ever need to make changes, you will need to go into each page and update all the styling. This is also a bit ineffecient.
